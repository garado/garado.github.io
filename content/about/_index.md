Hello there! I'm Alexis.

I'm a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I'm interested in embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics, and I'm currently searching for a full-time role in embedded software development.

In my free time, I'm probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time customizing my Linux setup.


##### Things I like
- **Music.** I play guitar, bass, and piano. My favorite band is Polyphia.
- **Reading.** [Here](https://vault.garado.dev/library/history/) is what I'm reading now.
