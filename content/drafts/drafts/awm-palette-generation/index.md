## Resources
- [Dribbble](). Lots of really good design inspiration to be found here.
- [Refactoring UI](). This is where I learned everything I needed to make Cozy look the way it does. It has great explanations and examples. It's quite expensive but there are free chapters available. I've also heard it can be found lying around online somewhere.
- [Material Design spec](). Another great resource similar to Refactoring UI.
