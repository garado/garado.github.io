- Started a new job at [Supernal](https://supernal.aero) working on embedded application software for electric aircraft
  - It's **AWESOME**
- Porting my [desktop setup](https://github.com/garado/cozy) from [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org) to [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags)
  - Saying goodbye to AwesomeWM feels bittersweet since I spent over 350 hours developing it ([I counted](https://timewarrior.net/)), but I enjoyed it, so... no regrets!
- Testing out NixOS in preparation for my new [Framework](https://frame.work/) laptop :-)
  - Arch has been nice, but it feels messy. The idea of a 100% declarative and reproducible system is incredible 
  - Also... right to repair!
- Slowly working on extending my [stepper motor project](/posts/stepper-motor-music) with some cool new features
