A few months ago I moved to the Bay Area to start a new job as a software engineer at [Supernal](https://supernal.aero) working energy storage systems for electric aircraft. It's awesome!

I'm porting my [desktop setup](https://github.com/garado/cozy) from [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org) to [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags). Saying goodbye to AwesomeWM feels bittersweet since I spent over 350 hours developing it ([I counted](https://timewarrior.net/)), but I enjoyed it, so... no regrets!

I got a new [Framework](https://frame.work/) laptop and I'm running NixOS on it. Arch has been nice, but it feels messy - lots of random fixes taken from 2009 forum posts :/ The idea of OS as code and having a completely reproducible system is really cool to me. The downside of it is that Nix has an incredibly steep learning curve, which I'm slowly starting to get over.

Lastly, I'm also slowly working on extending my [stepper motor project](/posts/stepper-motor-music) with some cool new features.
