Hello there!

I’m Alexis, a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I’m passionate about Linux, embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics, and I'm at my best when there's an interesting problem to solve or when I'm learning cool new things. I’m currently searching for a full-time role in embedded software development.

In my free time, I’m probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time tinkering with my Arch config.

This site is where I ramble about projects I’ve done and topics that I think are interesting. Enjoy your stay!
