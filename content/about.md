Hello there! I’m Alexis.

I’m Alexis, a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I’m passionate about embedded systems, computer architecture, Linux, and robotics, and I’m currently searching for a full-time role in embedded software development. In my free time, I’m probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time tinkering with my Arch config.

This site is where I ramble about projects I’ve done and topics that I think are interesting. Enjoy your stay!
