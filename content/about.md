Hello there!

I’m Alexis, a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I like figuring out how things work, solving problems, and above all, learning as much as I can. I’m passionate about Linux (Arch btw), embedded systems, and computer architecture, and I'm currently an embedded firmware engineer at [Supernal](https://supernal.aero/) working on energy storage systems for electric aircraft.

In my free time, I’m probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time tinkering with my AwesomeWM config.

This site is where I ramble about projects I’ve done and topics that I think are interesting. It's powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom fork of the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme. Enjoy your stay!
