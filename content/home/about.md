Hello there!

I'm a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I'm interested in embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics, and I'm currently searching for a full-time role. In my free time, I'm probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time customizing my Linux setup.
