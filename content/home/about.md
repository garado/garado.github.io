Hello there!

I'm Alexis, a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I'm interested in embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics, and I'm currently searching for a full-time role in embedded software development. In my free time, I'm probably playing guitar, messing with a microcontroller, or (most likely) spending way too much time tweaking [my Arch + AWM config](https://github.com/garado/cozy).

This is where I ramble about projects I've done and topics that I think are interesting.
