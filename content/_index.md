# Hello!
I'm Alexis, a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I like figuring out how things work, solving problems, and above all, learning as much as I can. Iâ€™m passionate about Linux (Arch btw), embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics. I work on energy storage systems for electric aircraft at [Supernal](https://www.supernal.aero/). I enjoy my work and I'm happy to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.
