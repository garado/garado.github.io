post about embedded systems

WHY I LIKE C AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
I came into college with absolutely zero prior programming experience. The very first programming language I 
learned was assembly in my CSE12 class. The quarter after I took that, I took an intro to C and embedded
systems course. Assembly is great and all, but I appreciated C so much more because it didn't take ten fucking
lines to add two integers together. Needless to say, I got attached to C and it's now my favorite language.

I had a professor who defined engineering as manipulating reality, and CSE 13 was my first experience actually doing that.
We worked with a 32-bit PICkit microcontroller and a chipKIT I/O shield. It was incredibly satisfying to know that I wrote code 
to make shit appear on the screen!!!!!!!!!!

I was a shit student in high school. I routinely put every off til the last minute, didn't really care about any course material, never did my
homework, and barely managed to get a 3.0 GPA.

When I got to CSE 12 and CSE 13, all of that changed - I was suddenly extremely interested and actually made an effort in school. It was like somebody
suddenly lit a fire under my ass and I was motivated to do well. For once I started assignments as soon as they were due and I found myself getting into flow
states that were hours long. I pulled 6+ hour work sessions not because it was due 11:59 PM that day, but because I was just that into it. One time 
I got stuck in downtown San Jose at 1AM for 3 hours waiting for a bus and I was perfectly content passing the time sitting on the side of
the road writing code.

I really like the general idea behind an embedded system - a little machine that has one job and dedicates itself entirely to doing it well. Admirable.
